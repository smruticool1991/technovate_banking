            <h2>Personal Loans</h2>
            <p>A personal loan is an unsecured loan. In simple terms, personal loan is used to fulfill your financial need without offering any collateral or any sort of security. Like other loans, a person does not have to put up collaterals like goods, assets or gold to avail the personal loan. Instead, a person needs to submit security of 1-2% to the loan service bank or NBFC.</p>

            <h2>Repayment Period</h2>
            <p>A repayment is the process of returning the borrowed money to the lender. It generally includes principal amount and interest rate. As said, Personal Loans are short to medium term loans to meet your immediate financial needs. So, a borrower can complete the repayment process in less than 2 months to 5-6 years. The repayment period for personal loans depends on the loan amount, EMI, and other company policies.</p>
            <p>For example, if you take a loan of Rs. 3 lakhs at the rate of 13% per annum with repayment tenure of 3 years or 36 months. Your EMI will be Rs. 10,108 per month (including interest rate and loan amount).</p>
            <p>The total payable amount at the end of 3 years would be Rs. 3,63,895/- ( Rs. 10,108 * 36). Therefore, you are paying a total interest amount to the tune of Rs 63,895. This, however, excludes other applicable charges which can be quantified as under: Loan Processing Charges, Documentation charges - 2%</p>
